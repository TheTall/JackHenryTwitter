Here are my code challenge results.<br> 
I decided to use a Queue collection to process the incoming data. <br> 
In production, this would be something more robust, like a RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus and Azure Function.<br> 
The results can be viewed by using the Swagger page for the RESTful API at https://localhost:7121/swagger/index.html<br> 
The API BearerToken is stored in the "appsettings.json".<br> 
I appreciate your time reviewing this.<br> 
Thanks,<br>
